## Agenda


- Proposal for project maturity levels (@fricklerhandwerk)

- Hydra: propose the repo to be not user-facing (@raitobezarius)
- Making this group more official? (@thufschmitt)
- Follow-up on the teams transparency (@thufschmitt)
  


## Proposal for project maturity levels

- Problem: Beginners have a hard time to evaluate what they can rely on in the Nix ecosystem, while stability and maturity is one of the major reasons to choose Nix.
- Goal: Significantly reduce the cognitive overhead for new and existing users when choosing Nix-related tools
- Prior art:
    - https://github.com/NixOS/foundation/issues/39
    - https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixcon-governance-workshop/32705/11
- Proposal:
    - Make something like [Thoughtworks' technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)
    - Proposed degrees of maturity and relevance:
    -   1. Ecosystem
          - Maturity:
              - Can be run or set up with one command using Nix
              - Project is alive
          - Relevance:
              - Supports a well-known use case
        2. Community
          - Maturity:
              - Has at least one active maintainer
              - Contributions are accepted regularly
              - Can be used without reading the source code
          - Relevance:
              - Supports a common use case
        3. Official
          - Maturity:
              - Is maintained by a community team
          - Relevance:
              - Supports an essential use case
     - Notes:
        - Higher degrees include lower degrees
        - Criteria deliberately leave room to interpretation and refinement
        - Community team leads should set up a decision-making scheme (e.g. majority vote) and regularly revise the list (e.g. every 6 months)


### Discussion

- @thufschmitt: agree on the big picture; decisionmaking is the crucial point
    - @fricklerhandwerk: this team could decide things; from experience all that's needed is someone to drive the process, make proposals, implement change requests
    - @garbas: add to that that anyone should be able to make proposals, e.g. in an issue
- @garbas: what we should add to the metrics is what we'd expect from maintainers. or should there even be obligations?
    - @fricklerhandwerk: the criteria already give an idea of that, and supposedly we should start evaluating based on that and refine as we go
    - @delroth: yes, if the same group of people makes the decisions, they should converge on something consistent. don't need to be exact up front
    - @garbas: should still be clear what it entails to have an official project, what to expect. is it more work, more visibility?
        - @delroth: and what do you get out of it?
            - @garbas: one thing could be eligibility for funding, etc.
                - also mention on the website or other visible places
                - @thufschmitt: having a project under the NixOS GitHub org should already signal higher trustworthyness than random other things
    - @thufschmitt: linking back to the NixOps4 discussion with @roberth as an example, a community-blessed project can be expected not to operate like an individual's project, where there will be some sharing of responsibilities. it's improtant to set expectations in that regard
- @delroth: taking a step back, having official projects also matters because official projects "block" development of alternatives that address the same use cases
    - @fricklerhandwerk: saying that particular problem areas have no canonical solution would also help, because currently much of that is simply up in the air
    - @garbas: would expect consolidation of alternatives given the proposed curation happens
    - @delroth: expect that setting up a bunch of criteria may produce no official projects in the end
        - @fricklerhandwerk: that's unlikely but would be fine; the purpose is to be honest about the situation
            - at least we'd know what to fix first
- @fricklerhandwerk: probably missing from the proposal is allocating a fixed amount of resources. if we do it in this group, we'd need to say how much time we spend regularly to achieve some measurable goal in a pre-determined amount of time
- @raitobezarius: agreed on having nix-community as a staging area
    - question on moderation issues: there was a recent PR to awesome-nix by a banned user that was reverted
        -  should nix-community align with moderation decisions? since we're tying nix-community to the "official" brand
        -  asked @zimbatm about it, but no answer yet
        -  it's important because nix-community is quite big and semi-official already
        -  @thufschmitt: would be ideal if we can get alignment
            -  @raitobezarius: ideally we'd be able to tell people to go to nix-community first and then graduate to official as theyr work matures
            -  @fricklerhandwerk: no owners here today, should discuss this together
            -  @delroth: there will probably be more action items for full alignment
                -  e.g. nix-community has their own funding and infra
                -  @fricklerhandwerk: the problem is not that they're independent entities, but whether we clearly say that's okay or not
- @janik: this team should probably not make the decisions because it will take too much time from the group
    - it's also somewhat unrelated to what we're trying to do here
    - teams can be asked for advice, but not run that process
    - anyone should be able to make proposals though
    - can run a call for action to have someone drive it
        - @fricklerhandwerk: and then this group can delegate the responsibility and back that person up
- @raitobezarius: we could invite leads of projects that have potential to become official
    - People affected by the change should drive this
    - Home Manager comes to mind
    - Could have proposals that will be accepted after a timeout when there are no objections
    - @thufschmitt: it will be easy for promoting, but hard from demoting
- decision:
    - we agree on the spirit of the proposal, but need to talk to nix-community owners
        - @thufschmitt will talk with @zimbatm
    - @fricklerhandwerk will post a call to action to find candidates to take the responsibility

## Hydra
        
## Hydra: propose the repo to 

- @raitobezarius: the infra team has needs towards the repo that are hard to implement
    - there is no maintenance going on
    - maybe we should have internal fork that will serve hydra.nixos.org?
    - @delroth: @zimbatm gave the infra team full access to the repo now
        - we can deal with our needs, but we don't have visibility into external use cases
- @raitobezarius: if we demote Hydra, how do we advertise to users that it's dead?
    - @thufschmitt: Hydra has a slightly bigger problem as opposed to NixOps, because more big-time users likely depend on it
    - @raitobezarius: if there are big internal deployments by companies that did not give back, arguably we don't have to care about continued support
        - such orgs are free to form a consortium to support Hydra development, but we currently don't see them participating in the community
- decision:
    - @raitobezarius: provide communication on the `README` and on Discourse about the state of maintenance
        - make recommendations for alternatives
        - @delroth will merge the PRs
    - let the infra team do what they need on some other branch

## Follow-up on the teams transparency

- https://pad.lassul.us/xac2tP0hTUWRKSf-5DWRjw#
- @thufschmitt will open a PR to nixos.org on the teams overview page
    - will discuss async there

## Making this group more official?

- @thufschmitt: should document what we're doing in a more structured fashion so people know. ideas?
    - @fricklerhandwerk: just follow the teams handbook maybe?
- @delroth: this doesn't feel team-shaped but rather assembly-shaped
- @garbas: this is a meta team; having a team would imply being part of this higher-kinded team
- no conclusion; ran out of time
