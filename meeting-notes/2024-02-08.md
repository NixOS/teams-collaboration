## Agenda


- [name=@thufschmitt]: Quick update on https://github.com/NixOS/teams-collaboration/issues/1
- [name=@thufschmitt]: Representation for the Nixpkgs day-to-day operations?
- [name=@JulienMalka]: Deployment of a self-hosted vaultwarden instance for the community 

## Repositories deprecation

- Most things clear and unambiguous
- NixOps:
    - @roberth wants to keep it and maintain it
    - Also develop a new version
        - No backwards compatibiliy constraint
        - @edolstra: If it's a new (incompatible) version, it should just get a new name
        - @thufschmitt: No reason for it to be an official tool _a priori_. Could just start in a dedicated org or `nix-community`, and then become official if it really becomes great
    - Main concern: Not confuse new users by leading them to believe that they should use NixOps
        - Currently NixOps is on the top google results, mentioned on the Wiki, etc..
    Decision? Broad agreement on sunsetting it one way or another, but Roberth is still the maintainer, so need to be discussed with him.
    - @infinisil will talk to him

Next steps: @thufschmitt will go through all the repositories that didn't oppose and archive them.
    - Also put out a discourse post to announce it
    (EDIT: since the issues asking for a clarification of the status mention a one month grace period, this will wait until Feb 22)

## Nixpkgs representation

- What's the problem for that solution?
    - @thufschmitt: Having a group of people that
        1. Could be exposed as a point of contact (on the website for instance) for outsiders
        2. Could help resolve contentious nixpkgs-wide concerns
    - @tomberek: there is no stable set of contacts for Nixpkgs
        - leads to a perception of high-risk
        - leads to a perception of disorganization

- @raitobezarius: Might not fit the Nixpkgs model where most contributors are too ephemeral to be commitable long-term
- @infinisil: Proposal to have a repo that specifies the code owners of all repos and resources
    - PRs to add/change codeowners have to be announced beforehand for community consensus
    - Assign Nixpkgs code owners idea: @infinisil, @raito, @roberth, release manager
    - Could make decisions without RFCs
    - Would specify how it will be curated
    - Should also be applicable to the repo level
    - Intending to make an RFC to specify this

- @thufschmitt: Want to know who's responsible for which file in Nixpkgs
    - @raitobezarius: Lots of individual parts in Nixpkgs, doesn't seem doable
    - @imincik: Give more power to maintainers
    - @infinisil: There's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS)
        - @thufschmitt: Pretty much answers my question
        - @raitobezarius: A bit outdated, needs to be more curated
        - @imincik: GitHub teams vs maintainer/team-list.nix
        - @infinisil: Would be great to have synchronized

- @raitobezarius: No public event stream for Nixpkgs, hard to automate stuff without
- @infinisil: Can make the webhook stream public
    - Idea: Have a repo where people can add their own server URLs to get webhook events for the entire NixOS org. Allows PRs to get events


## Vaultwarden self-hosted instance

@JulienMalka: Deployed by the infra team, the Bitwarden accounts will be migrated there. No limit any more, so can be used by everyone
- Eelco: Does this mean that the admins of the vaultwarden instance have access to all our secrets? 
    - @JulienMalka: Can check
- @infinisil What is this for?
    - @JulienMalka: Password manager to share secrets among a team

@JulienMalka: If there's something else to self-host, feel free to contact the non-critical infra team

## This week in NixOS

- Experiment launched by @raitobezarius et al. to give regular updates about things that happen in the community: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-testing-this-week-in-nixos/39465

---

For next time:
- Graduating new projects to make them official (`home-manager`)
- @infinisil's proposal for code ownership
